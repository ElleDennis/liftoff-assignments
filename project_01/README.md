# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
My project, Remainder, serves as an online broker for leftover or unused construction materials. Sixty-five million gallons of paint is thrown away yearly in the United States. Using Remainder builders, construction teams and design practitioners can divert construction and demolition (C&D) materials from disposal by posting, viewing and selecting remaining and project specific products, recycled and salvaged products easily and efficiently.
## Features
The user will register to view and/or post written information and photos describing construction materials that remain and/or are salvaged upon the completion of a construction project. In the post form, the user will also identify which construction category a material belongs, so that a user may consult posts by category. The data from registration and user postings will be persisted in a database. User login and post creation features have already been coded into Remainder. The database is set up. I plan to provide include a search function via categories. Once this is functioning, I plan to add edit and destroy features to the posts. 
## Technologies
Remainder is coded primarily in Java. I am working in IntelliJ and am also using Hibernate, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf and MAMP.
## What I'll Have to Learn
Persistence continues to challenge me. But once it is working, I would like to explore authentication and mapping of the locations of the postings.
